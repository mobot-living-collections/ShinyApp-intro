# How to share a Shiny App

from https://shiny.posit.co/r/getstarted/shiny-basics/lesson7/

**When it comes to sharing Shiny apps, you have two basic options:**

- Share your Shiny app as R scripts. This is the simplest way to share an app, but it works only if your users have R on their own computer (and know how to use it). Users can use these scripts to launch the app from their own R session, just like youâ€™ve been launching the apps so far in this tutorial.

- Share your Shiny app as a web page. This is definitely the most user friendly way to share a Shiny app. Your users can navigate to your app through the internet with a web browser. They will find your app fully rendered, up to date, and ready to go.
